			<p class="c-intro__summary">Clothparency is a french startup that aims at changing the fashion industry by bringing more transparency to it. They provide information on the ethicality of clothes to the end-consumers so that they can make reasoned purchase decisions. I collaborated with their team to improve the user experience and design of their app. I specifically focussed on the rating system to make it more trustworthy and intuitive to understand. The main challenge of this project was to develop a solution that is only using the existing resources and can be easily implemented.</p>

			<p class="c-section__body">Clothes are a fundamental part of our everyday life. They are worn by almost everyone, nearly all the time. However, the way how we produce and use clothes is extremely harmful to the environment and people.</p>
			<p class="c-section__body">The production requires large amounts of nonrenewable resources while the workers are often exposed to dangerous environments and inhumane conditions. On top of that, the textile industry causes water pollution, massive greenhouse gas emissions, animal abuse, forced labour and even child labour. And all of this, only to produce clothes that are often worn for only a short period, after which the materials are largely lost to landfill or incineration.</p>

			<p class="c-section__body">Clothparency aims at transforming the textile industry by empowering consumers with data. They provide information on the environmental and social impact of clothing products to enable consumers to make a reasoned purchase decision. Users can either browse an extensive catalogue of brands and products or scan the barcode of a product directly in the store.</p>
			<p class="c-section__body">As part of my Master's programme, I collaborated with Clothparency for five weeks to improve the user experience and design of their product. Since I only had a few hours a week for this project, the first challenge was to find an area in which I could effectively support the team with my expertise. After an initial meeting, we decided to focus on the rating page of the app.</p>

			<p class="c-section__body">As an initial step, I conducted a user experience review of the existing rating page to detect possible usability issues. I noticed, that one major area of improvement was the rating system itself. Since it’s a core element of the whole app, I decided to focus my attention on this issue.</p>
			<p class="c-section__body">After researching best practices, analyzing other apps and websites, and looking into psychological research on rating systems, I developed a series of possible improvements. Both, the identified usability issues and the suggested improvements, are shown below.</p>

			<p class="c-section__body">Based on the identified usability issues and possible improvements, I started sketching a variety of new concepts and then created low-fidelity wireframes in Sketch.</p>
			<p class="c-section__body">Initially, I worked towards developing a scale that includes the absolute rating (i.e. the overall rating of the product) as well as the relative rating (i.e. the rating of the product in relation to other products from the same brand or in the same price range). However, the feedback from a quick user test was very clear: While the provided information added value to the product, they were too complicated to understand.</p>

			<p class="c-section__body">I went back to the sketching board to find a way to show the relative rating in an easier, less technical way. This eventually led to the idea to show the relative rating along with the most important insights of the product's rating just below the absolute rating.</p>
			<p class="c-section__body">Some further user testing did not only confirm that this approach was easier to understand but also showed that users appreciated having the most important information highlighted right in the beginning.</p>
