			<div class="c-intro__summary">
				<p>Due to the growing complexity of its product line-up, the start-up wanted to centralize its account management. The customers should be able to easily manage their user profile and organization settings. I was hired by the start-up to design the dashboard based on a series of user stories which they provided. The main challenge of this project was to make the editing of data as seamless as possible while preventing accidental data changes.</p>

			<h3 class="c-section__heading">Introducing Centralized Account Management </h3>
			<p class="c-section__body">Over the last years, the start-up has continuously evolved its product line-up and grown its customer base. As more and more users started to use several of their products, they wanted to simplify the account management by having one central account for all products.</p>
			<p class="c-section__body">With the upcoming introduction of teams and user roles, the start-up decided to create a centralized customer interface. This interface should allow their customers to edit their account settings, permissions of other users in their team, as well as their organizations’ payment details and subscriptions.</p>

			<h3 class="c-section__heading">Sitemap & Wireframing</h3>
			<p class="c-section__body">Since the start-up already provided an elaborate list of user stories and personas, I began the UX design process with a headstart. I used the user stories to structure the content into logical sections and to create a sitemap.</p>
			<p class="c-section__body">I've tried to keep the naming conventions and structure of other customer interfaces, so users will already feel familiar with the customer interface the first time they use it. Based on the sitemap, I then started to create the first iteration of the wireframes.</p>

			<h3 class="c-section__heading">Best Practices for Data Editing</h3>
			<p class="c-section__body">Since the product is going to contain sensitive user data and important organization information, it is crucial that users can not delete or change this data by accident. However, the editing of the data should also not take too much time or too many clicks, as this would result in a poor user experience.</p>
			<p class="c-section__body">Therefore, I’ve explored different approaches and best practices for data editing used by other customer interfaces. The approaches ranged from the very time-efficient but error-prone solutions, such as the one used by Atlassian ID, to the very click-intensive but safe solutions, like the one used by Google.</p>

			<h3 class="c-section__heading">Data Editing in Customer ID</h3>
			<p class="c-section__body">Based on my research on data editing, I decided to go for a mixed approach for Customer ID. Personal account information, such as the username, email address or password, are crucial to the user but not expected to change very often. Thus, the design should prevent accidental data changes at all costs. </p>
			<p class="c-section__body">In contrast, if administrators change permissions and data of other users, they are likely to change multiple items at once. Thus, this process should be as frictionless and time-effective as possible.</p>

			<h3 class="c-section__heading">The Final Design</h3>
			<p class="c-section__body">After going through a couple of iterations and feedback loops with the client, I could start designing the user interface based on the wireframes. In this process, I specifically focussed on aligning the design with the brand guidelines of the start-up. We went through several design variations, testing the look and feel of a dark and light theme until we reached the design.</p>
