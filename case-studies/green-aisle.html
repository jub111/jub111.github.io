			<p class="c-intro__summary">Our daily food consumption is causing a variety of environmental and social issues. Many consumers want to reduce their impact by purchasing more ethical products. However, they often fail at doing so, as they face a variety of challenges. The objective of this project was to design an app that addresses these challenges and assists people in consuming more ethically. The design of the app is informed by the research and insights I’ve gained through my masters’ thesis.</p>

			<p class="c-section__body">Our generation faces a variety of unprecedented environmental and social issues. While the consequences of climate change are getting worse with every day, many companies continue to pollute the environment, pay their workers poverty wages, and stash their profits in offshore tax havens.</p>
			<p class="c-section__body">Unfortunately, the food industry is no exception. With its massive carbon footprint, unsustainable farming practices, and unethical company politics, the industry is contributing to many of these issues. Therefore, we have to fundamentally change how and what we consume. We have to carefully choose what we buy and look behind the brands, so we can choose products that have a positive impact on people, the planet and animals.</p>

			<h3 class="c-section__heading">The Intention-Behaviour Gap</h3>
			<p class="c-section__body">More and more consumers want to reduce the impact of their consumption by purchasing more ethical products. However, they often fail at doing so, as they face a variety of challenges. Studies revealed that only 10-15% of the people who intend to consume ethically, actually purchase ethical products. In scientific research, this problem is referred to as the intention-behaviour gap.</p>

			<p class="c-section__body">The reasons for the existence of the intention-behaviour gap are equally complex and multi-faceted as ethical consumption itself. For instance, it requires a lot of time to do the required research, the willingness to compromise and sacrifice existing comforts, as well as the willpower to stick to the newly established shopping routines.</p>
			<p class="c-section__body">Through my research, I’ve gained insights into these challenges and struggles of over 100 ethical consumers. When I categorised these problems into different groups, four main problems became apparent.</p>
