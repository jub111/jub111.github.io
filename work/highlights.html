			<h2>The Idea</h2>
			<p>
				Imagine you visit a friend who lives in a town you have never been before. Sure, your friend will tell you everything about the popular sights that you can visit. But he will also guide you to all his beloved spots that you cannot find in travel guides: The most delicious burger in town, his favorite cafe just around the corner, a secret underground club and the best park to hang out. Those hidden gems are the ones that make a town really unique, and being at those places is probably going to create most memorable experiences. The purpose of Highlights is to create a platform to share and explore those hidden gems.

			<h2>The Process</h2>
			<h3>User Stories</h3>
			<p>
				We wanted to create a minimalistic app that has yet all the features necessary. Therefore we started to write down user stories. Those user stories helped us to abstract all the requirements into small chunks and discuss their individual necessity and benefits as well as their relationship to other user stories.
			</p>

			</div>			

			<span class="spacer--32"></span>

			<h3>Market Research</h3>
			<p>
				Our next step was to do some market research. We’ve downloaded almost every app we could find on the App Store or Google Play Store that has a similar use case. Furthermore, we did some research on dribbble and Behance to find new and creative designs and concepts.
			</p>

			<span class="spacer--32"></span>


			<h3>Sketching</h3>
			<p>
				With all this inspiration and planning in mind, we started sketching. We began with modifying and mixing existing concepts, and after some time we tried to come up with some new ideas and started exploring novel patterns.
			</p>

			<span class="spacer--52"></span>

			<div class="text-block__inline-image-block">
				<img src="/assets/images/articles/highlights/article-wireframes.jpg" alt="">
			</div>		

			<span class="spacer--32"></span>

			<p>
				Soon, we realized that there are two interesting ways to approach the design of the app: Either the app can support the user in the process of <u>finding places he is searching for</u>, or the app can enable the user to <u>explore a city</u> by showing the whole range of exciting and unique places it offers.
				<br><br>
				We decided to create two competing concepts and let the users decide which approach they like most.
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="article__text-block">
		<div class="container">
			<h2>Concept #1 — Find And Search Places</h2>
			<p>
				This concept is based on ideas and patterns that have already been used multiple times in different apps. While it’s definitely not the most exciting concept, it’s probably a safe choice to create a intuitive and useable experience. The app consist of two main screens: A list screen, where you can scroll through a list of locations, and map screen, where you can explore a map with markers for each location.
			</p>

			</div>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="article__text-block">
		<div class="container">
			<h2>Concept #2 — The Exploration Approach</h2>
			<p>
				The motivation of this concept is to emphasize that each place that is shown within this app is worth exploring. Therefore, we decided to force the user to view each place seperately. By doing so, we hope that users might find places they usually wouldn't consider visiting.
			</p>

			<span class="spacer--52"></span>

			<div class="text-block__inline-image-block">

			</div>

			<span class="spacer--52"></span>

			<p>
				If you start the app, you first see the search view. First, you can select if you want to search for places nearby or places in specific towns. Second, you can filter the results for specific categories, such as restaurants, bars, or parks. With a click on the search button this card is going to slide up to the top of the screen and the first results appears. You can navigate between results by swiping left and right. A swipe down will pull down the filters again. A swipe up or click on the results will open the details view.

				<br><br>

				When we're happy with the wireframes, we started to design the app using Sketch.

			<h2>Next Steps</h2>
			<p>
				Our next step is to built interactive prototypes for both concepts and conduct some user testing to find out which concept they prefer and what elements may be improved.
