					As part of an university project, we created the immersive flight simulator <b>Zero Gravity</b>. Our goal was to convey the feeling of flying by combining three innovative technologies: Oculus Rift, Kinect, and Unity. We wanted people to have the opportunity to experience the world virtually in mid-air.

			<h2>Our Approach</h2>
			<p>
				To create this experience we mainly focused on the goal to develop a preferably intuitive, easily understandable and realistic control of movement which is as comfortable as possible and offers a great adventure to the user. We implemented two control concepts:
			</p>

			<span class="spacer--32"></span>

			<h3>Superman Control</h3>
			<p>
				With the superman control method the user controls the steering by pointing his fist in the desired direction. The control output is relative to a predefined neutral position that has to be calibrated in advance.
			</p>

			<span class="spacer--32"></span>

			<h3>
				Bird Controll
			</h3>
			<p>
				This concept involves more parts of the user's body. For the initial position, the users have to straighten both arms like imitating wings. To make a left turn, the user has to lower the left arm and raise the right arm for a little bit - just like birds or glider do. A right turn works vice versa. Ascending or descending in the air is caused by changing the spinal position up or down.

			<h2>Evaluation of Control Concepts</h2>
			<p>
				To compare both control methods, we conducted two different studies with the Zero Gravity Flight Simulator. In both studies, a within-subject design was used, and the participants were asked to navigate through a flight course.
			</p>

			<span class="spacer--52"></span>

			<h3>The First Study</h3>
			<p>
				We aimed to find out which of the two controls is the most intuitive, simplest and easiest to understand we conducted a study. The participants rated their experience in the categories intuition, simplicity, comprehensibility and consistency. It became very apparent that almost every test subject favored the superman-control. In each category which included aspects like intuition, simplicity, comprehensibility and consistency we got results of 2 or better (1 = excellent, 6 = insufficient). Merely the physical effort was rated a little bit worse.
			</p>

			<span class="spacer--32"></span>

			<h3>The Second Study</h3>
			<p>
				Our second study aimed to compare the control methods based on quantitative data. We tracked the time it took the participants to reach the gates during the experiment and the accuracy how close to the center of the target gates they flew through.
