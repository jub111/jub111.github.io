				As part of an university project we created the immersive flight simulator "Zero Gravity". Our goal was to convey the feeling of flying by combining three innovative technologies: Oculus Rift, Kinect and Unity. We wanted people to have the opportunity to experience the world virtually in midair.
			</p>
			<p>
				The project was presented at the <a class="underlined" href="http://ieeevr.org/2016/" target="_blank">IEEE VR 2016</a> conference and featuered in the <a class="underlined" href="http://www.airspacemag.com/daily-planet/bird-or-superman-whats-best-way-fly-virtual-reality-180958578/?no-ist" target="_blank">Air & Space Magazine</a>.

			<h3>Our Approach</h3>
			<p>
				In order to create this experience we mainly focused on the goal to develop a preferably intuitive, easily understandable and realistic control of movement which is as comfortable as possible and offers a great adventure to the user. We implemented two control concepts: 
			</p>
			
			<h4>Superman Control</h4> 
			<p>
				With the superman control method the user controls the steering by pointing his fist in the desired direction. The control output is relative to a predefined neutral position that has to be calibrated in advance.
			</p>

			<h4>Bird Controll</h4>
			<p>
				This concept involves more parts of the users body. For the initial position the users have to straighten both arms like imitating wings. In order to make a left turn, the user has to lower the left arm and raise the right arm for a little bit - just like birds or glider do. A right turn works vice versa.  Ascending or descending in the air is caused by changing the spinal position up or down.

			<h3>Evaluation of Control Concepts</h3>
			<p>
				In order to compare both control methods we conducted two different studies with the Zero Gravity Flight Simulator. In both studies a within subject design was used and the participants were asked to navigate through a flight course.

			<h4>The First Study</h4>
			<p>
				We aimed to find out which of the two controls is the most intuitive, simplest and easiest to understand we conducted a study. The participants rated their experience in the categories intuition, simplicity, comprehensibility and consistency. It became very clear that the superman-control was favored by almost every test subject. In every category which included aspects like intuition, simplicity, comprehensibility and consistency we got results of 2 or better (1 = excellent, 6 = insufficient). Merely the physical effort was rated a little bit worse.
			</p>

			<h4>The Second Study</h4>
			<p>
				Our second study aimed to compare the control methods based on quantitative data. We tracked the time it took the participants to reach the gates during the experiment and the accuracy how close to the center of the target gates they flew through.
